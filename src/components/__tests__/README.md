# TEST Strategy
BDD from the most important flows from the app which are:
* Visualizing the introduction screen
* Starting the game
* Player X placing an "X" in the board
* Player X winning the game
* A draw between Player X and O

Note: There is only one test because I ran out of time to cover the rest of the application, so I decided to test the core features from the application.+
